      /* Interpolation */
      /* Is the process of filling in all of the in between frames of an animation */

      /* There are different ways to interpolate the in-between frames.
        Known as easing:atenuacion functions, you can set the inerpolation to start off
        slow and then speed up as it gets closer to teh end.  */

      /* An example is linear easing. The circle grows at a constaint pace:ritmo
    from start to the end */
